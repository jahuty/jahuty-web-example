## Customizing the examples

Our examples use snippets that we control. Of course, it's more fun if you use your own.

If you haven't already, [sign up](https://app.jahuty.com/sign-up), and we'll provision your account with an organization, an API key, and a few welcome snippets.

Then, to use your snippets in the examples:

1. _Change the API key._ Open `index.js` and replace our API key with yours.
1. _Change the snippet id._ Open `snippet.html` and replace our snippet id with yours.

Refresh the page, and you should see your snippet's content in the document!

## That's it!
